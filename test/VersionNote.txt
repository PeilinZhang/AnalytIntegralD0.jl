Problems in this version:

1. Impossible cases appears. The values used to test in testL.jl are:
vertices1 = [ [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0] ]
vertices2 = [ [1.0, 1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 2.0, 1.0] ]
Or
vertices1 = [ [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0] ]
vertices2 = [ [1.0, 1.0, 0.0], [2.0, 1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 2.0, 0.0] ]




----------------------------------------------------
Plans for the next version:
The Matlab code provided with the paper set the lowest two h values to be zero.
I do not really understand why do they do that, although the lemmas say at least
2 h values should be zero.
It is possible that it is just for rounding values that are small enough to zero.
