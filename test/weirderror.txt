Problems:

1. the h value calculated is different every time.

2. in I1.jl, some value is of type "nothing" but I cannot find which one.

3. When running debugger, the global variant case (defined in AnalytIntegralD0.jl) is not changing when the cases() function finish, which seems cause a problem in I1.jl
